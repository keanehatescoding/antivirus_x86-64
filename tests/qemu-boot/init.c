/* Minimal PID 1 for the QEMU-boot runtime CI job (see
 * .github/workflows/qemu-boot-test.yml) - actually boots a kernel,
 * insmod's av.ko, and confirms EICAR detection fires for real, unlike
 * build-matrix.yml's compile-only testing. No busybox, no shell -
 * just enough libc + a couple of direct syscalls to mount what's
 * needed, load the module, exec a clean file and an EICAR file, check
 * the results against dmesg, print one final PASS/FAIL line to the
 * serial console, and power off. Statically linked.
 *
 * See also cold_launcher.c (same directory) - a dedicated companion
 * binary this one execs partway through, as a regression test for
 * #87 (cold userspace pathname pages missed by the old syscall-entry
 * kprobe - see its own header comment, and av/main.c's
 * handler_pre_bprm_check()).
 *
 * All output goes through outmsg() (vsnprintf into a buffer + a raw
 * write(2) to fd 1) rather than stdio - printf()+fflush() was tried
 * first and its output never reached the serial console (kernel
 * printk output appeared fine; only userspace stdio output was
 * lost), for reasons not fully root-caused. write() sidesteps
 * whatever that was rather than chasing it further.
 *
 * Runs in one of two modes:
 *   - argv[1] == "--clean-marker": immediately exit(42). This is what
 *     gets exec'd as the "definitely not malicious" test case - no
 *     separate coreutils/busybox binary needed, we just re-exec
 *     ourselves.
 *   - no args (PID 1): the actual init/test-runner logic below.
